AutoEncoder Prototype Experiment (Mark-II) Work Log
==========================================

Update on June 8th 2018
------------------------

After data cleaning and data preparation, the training data is located in ./md_0_2_new_0. There are 31 data files named from md_0_2_new.0 to md_0_2_new.30. In each file 10 frames of simulated coordinates are stored. So there are 10(frames)*33876(num of atoms)*3(3d coordinates) in each file and total 310(frames)*33876(num of atoms)*3(3d coordinates) in /md_0_2_new_0.

Data perparation is pretty labour-intense so we can start with these data. We train the model for 25 steps with mini-batch of 10 frames and validate with 5 steps with mini-batch of 10 frames.

------------------------

It's shown that training data is not sufficient. Simulation is re-run with checkpoint and new data is genereated every 100 steps. Data is stored in GROMACS_data under data. data_100step_1000seg contains 10000 steps simulation where data from each step is cut to 1000 atoms; and data_300steps_10000seg contains 30000 steps.

Todo: test sigmoid over relu, test trainning with single frame(bad, but just to find out), test adam optimizer.
