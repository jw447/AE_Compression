AutoEncoder Experiment
======================

In this project, we aim to build an modern compressor using AutoEncoder to compress scientific datasets.

Data Description
---------------
GROMACS_data contains two sets of dataset, **data_100step_1000seg** and **data_300step_1000seg**, where they contains 10000 frames and 30000 frames respectively. Each frame from simulation contains the 3-D coordinates of 33876 atoms at each certain time step. We work with 1000 atoms first so data has been cut to 1000 rows per frame.

Getting Started
---------------

- Model Training

```python
$ python3 auto_encoder_train.py
```

- Model Evaluation

```python
$ python3 auto_encoder_eval.py
```
